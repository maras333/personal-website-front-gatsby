I started my career mainly as a frontend developer, but as time was passing by I started to be more focused on backend and it stayed like that till now. My skills are quite wide: from back-end to front-end development. I enjoy each aspect of it (but solving back-end challenges the most:-)), and building sites from start to finish. I'm available for remote work. </p><p>After hours I ride a bike a lot and fast as a road cyclist and it feels great!</p><p>If you would like to build something together, get in touch!</p>",
